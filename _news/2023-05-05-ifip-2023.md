Together with a colleague, I founded a [QUIC Interest Group](https://net.in.tum.de/projects/quic/) that brings together researchers and students with an interest in QUIC. Interests cover performance measurements, the analysis of different libraries but also Internet-wide measurements to evaluate QUIC deployments.

An outcome of this group, a performance evaluation of different libraries on a 10G link has been accepted to be published at [IFIP Networking 2023](https://networking.ifip.org/2023/). You can find a preprint of this work [here](https://www.net.in.tum.de/fileadmin/bibtex/publications/papers/jaeger2023quic.pdf)
