Two weeks Lion Steger presented our latest insights and extensions to the [IPv6 Hitlist Service](https://ipv6hitlist.github.io/) at TMA 2023 and received the best paper award. The work categorized the Hitlist based on network types and evaluated target generation algorithms under different conditions.

The [paper](https://tma.ifip.org/2023/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2023/06/tma2023-final50.pdf) is avaialable for more information. We further added a new historic and ongoing categorization as part of the Hitlist service for everybody to use. New responsive addresses will also be visible shortly.
