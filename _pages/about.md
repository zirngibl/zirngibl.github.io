I am a research associate and PhD candidate at the [Chair of Network Architecures and Services](https://net.in.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/)

I focus on large scale analysis and measurements targeting the Internet. My core areas are the analysis of network deployments and their peculiarities. My work relies on multiple protocols spanning networking layers, such as IPv6, DNS, TLS, QUIC.

The goal is to reach a better understanding of the Internet and understand the impact of often disregarded influences such as Off-Net deployments.

I am part of the [Global Internet Observatory (GINO)](https://net.in.tum.de/projects/gino/), a interest group at our chair focusing on Internet measurements.
