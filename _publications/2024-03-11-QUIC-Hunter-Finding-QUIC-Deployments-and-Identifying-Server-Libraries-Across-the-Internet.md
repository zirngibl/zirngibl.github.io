abstract: "The diversity of QUIC implementations poses challenges for Internet measurements and the analysis of the QUIC ecosystem. While all implementations follow the same specification and there is general interoperability differences in performance, functionality, but also security (e.g., due to bugs) can be expected. Therefore, knowledge about the implementation of an endpoint on the Internet can help researchers, operators, and users to better analyze connections, performance, and security. In this work, we improved the detection rate of QUIC scans to find more deployments and provide an approach to effectively identify QUIC server libraries based on CONNECTION_CLOSE frames and transport parameter orders. We performed Internet-wide scans and identified at least one deployment for 18 QUIC libraries. In total, we can identify the libraries with 8.0M IPv4 and 2.5M IPv6 addresses. We provide a comprehensive view of the landscape of competing QUIC libraries."
