From 2019 until 2024, I was a teaching assistant for Advanced Computer Networking (ACN) at the Technical University of Munich.
The lecture presents advanced concepts for building computer networks.
I was involved in multiple lecture blocks (including IPv4/IPv6 and Internet measurements) and the exercises.
Furthermore, I developed and supervise a student project regarding QUIC implementations and performance measurements together with a colleague.
