Since 2019, I am offering topics at the Innovative Internet Technologies and Mobile Communications (IITM) Seminar  of the Chair of Network Architectures and Services at the Technical University of Munich.
The seminar is offered twice a semester, normally during the semester and as block seminar during the break.
Goal of the seminar is to conduct a first scientific research on an indicidual topic.
Each topic is advised by a research assoicate of the chair best suited for each topic.
